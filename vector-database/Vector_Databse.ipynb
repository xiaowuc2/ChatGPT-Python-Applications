They exchange vows of love and plan to marry, but there is no mention of them spending the night together. Later in Act III, Scene 5, Juliet's mother urges her to marry Paris, and Juliet refuses, stating that she is already married to Romeo. This suggests that they did indeed marry, but again, there is no mention of them spending the night together. Overall, the text is ambiguous on this point and leaves it up to interpretation.\""
